# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied, despite appearing to be correctly implemented.  The issue is intermittent and may affect only certain classes or components.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a possible solution.

## Problem

The core problem is that some Tailwind classes fail to apply their styles as expected. This might be due to several underlying reasons, including but not limited to:

* **Incorrect configuration:** Problems in the Tailwind setup, such as missing or misconfigured purge options.
* **CSS specificity issues:** Other CSS rules might override the Tailwind classes.
* **Conflicting class names:** Naming conflicts could cause unpredictable behavior.
* **Build process issues:** Errors during the build or compilation process prevent Tailwind from properly processing your CSS.

## Solution

The solution file suggests a few approaches to try and resolve the inconsistency in the application of Tailwind CSS classes. This should be examined in conjunction with your specific project setup and potentially involves carefully reviewing and adjusting Tailwind configuration, CSS specificity and order, ensuring proper class naming conventions, and checking your build processes.
